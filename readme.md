# VIDEO PLAYBACK CONTROLLER
This was a fun one, I learned a lot and I didn't feel in the dark at all.  I don't think I could write this on my own but I certainly understood everything that was going on.

#TIL
* A lot over the last few days which made this lesson click better
* I can recognize and identify various parts of JS without much question or hesistation now
* video playback was fun to learn
* math in the function wasn't _AS_ daunting (but still pretty bad)
* I learned some neat shortcuts with ATOM (and some plugins)
* I only had a few errors in my code when writing it out
* I learned how to add pictures to readme.md markup
